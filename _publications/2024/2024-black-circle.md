  This study evaluates a novel treatment for infraorbital dark circles using adipose-derived extracellular matrix concentrate (ACF) injections. Ninety-four female patients aged 20-38 received ACF fillers, with follow-ups conducted over eight months. Results showed a high satisfaction rate, with 86% of participants reporting significant improvements in skin brightness, tightness, and smoothness. Over 97% were rated as “improved” by independent assessors, with no adverse effects noted. The findings suggest that ACF fillers provide effective periorbital rejuvenation and bio-stimulation with regenerative properties.
