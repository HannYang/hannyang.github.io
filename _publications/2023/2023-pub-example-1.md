  Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and sclerodermatous GVHD are autoimmune diseases characterized by severe skin fibrosis due to immune dysfunction. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies show promise in regulating the immune system, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting fibrosis. This review focuses on the role of MSC therapies in treating SSc and Scl-GVHD through these mechanisms.
