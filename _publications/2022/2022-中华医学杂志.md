  Autologous fat transfer has been used not only for filling soft tissue defects, but has also shown great potential for inhibiting fibrosis and promoting scar tissue remodeling in recent years. In this paper, we focus on the treatment of hypertrophic scars (HTSs) and review the possible mechanisms and clinical applications of adipose tissue and its derivatives for the treatment of HTSs, aiming to further develop the application of adipose transplantation and adipose stem cells, and provide more new strategies for the comprehensive treatment of HTSs.
