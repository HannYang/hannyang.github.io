  This study analyzed the anatomy of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) in 66 ankle specimens. It found significant variability in the size and shape of the ATFL, while the angle between the ATFL and CFL remained consistent. Most CFLs attached anterior to the tip of the fibula, rather than directly at the tip. These findings provide essential anatomical data to improve surgical treatment of lateral ankle ligament injuries.
