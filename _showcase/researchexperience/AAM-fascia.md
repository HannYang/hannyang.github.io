    <h5>The Subcutaneous Fascia-mediated Angiogenesis and Adipogenesis of Adipose Acellular Matrix.</h5>
    <hr />

        This project was the focus of my master’s research, and I’m excited to share that our paper is currently under review.

        Repairing severe injuries and soft tissue defects is challenging, with vascularization essential for tissue engineering success. Regenerative biomaterials, especially natural ones, show promise by reducing immune response and promoting vascular integration, making them key for tissue restoration. For this work, I extracted a decellularized extracellular matrix from human adipose tissue, making it an ideal model for studying biomaterial vascularization due to its natural origin and lack of host cell interference.

        Initially, I observed that the vasculature in our matrix derived from a host-generated collagen membrane formed on its surface, which seemed at first consistent with the foreign-body capsule response often observed with implants. However, by employing vessel-tracing techniques, I discovered that the true vascular source was the subcutaneous fascia rather than the surrounding tissue. Using in situ matrix-tracing, cell-tracing, Sirius red staining, and collagen type analysis, I uncovered a surprising finding: the collagen matrix wasn’t a result of a foreign-body reaction but rather a migrated layer of fascia that brought with it embedded blood vessels. Through repeated experiments—including fascia removal and blocking—I confirmed that this migrating fascia was essential for the matrix’s vascularization.

        The second part of this study explored the changes in vascular structures within the migrating fascia on the matrix surface. Using SEM and whole-mount staining, I observed a clear temporal pattern: blood vessels first developed on the matrix surface before penetrating into its core. Employing CurveAlign and R for fiber analysis, I found a correlation between this vascular growth pattern and the collagen architecture of the fascia, suggesting that fascia collagen might be directing vascularization.

        Interestingly, the migrating fascia also exhibited spontaneous adipogenesis—a phenomenon I’m investigating further to understand whether it is induced by the adipose-derived matrix or other unknown factors. Going forward, I plan to continue exploring the role of fascia collagen in regulating blood vessel formation and its connection to this spontaneous adipogenesis.
