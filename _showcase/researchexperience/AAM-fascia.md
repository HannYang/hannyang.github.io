    <h5>The Subcutaneous Fascia-mediated Angiogenesis and Adipogenesis of Adipose Acellular Matrix.</h5>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Repairing severe injuries or large soft tissue defects remains a significant challenge in clinical practice. Tissue engineering has emerged as a promising solution by using regenerative biomaterials to restore damaged tissues, with effective vascularization being critical to the success of these implants. Current methods aim to stimulate blood vessels to invade the implant, but the host-implant vascular connection process is not well understood. Unlike synthetic materials, regenerative <code>biomaterials</code> from natural sources may reduce typical immune responses and encourage vascularization and integration, highlighting a need to explore how they enhance tissue regeneration.
