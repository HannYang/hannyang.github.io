    <h5 class="card-title">Differentiating Vascular Matrix Complex (VMC) from Foreign Body Capsule</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      This project builds on our "Fascia-Mediated Biomaterial Vascularization" research. Our earlier findings revealed that the collagenous membrane, the VMC, surrounding implanted matrices resembles migrated fascia rather than a typical foreign body capsule.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      Here, we compared histological properties between VMC and the fibrotic capsules of silicone implants, finding significant differences in thickness, collagen content, fiber density, and cellular infiltration. We also demonstrated the potential of Sodium Succinate to reduce fibrosis, offering promising insights for preventing post-implant contractures.
