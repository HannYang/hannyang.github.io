    <h5 class="card-title">Hands-On Anatomy: Building Surgical Insight and Research Foundations through Dissection</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      This experience was a truly formative one that ignited my passion for surgery. During my undergraduate years, I engaged in a two-year anatomy practicum at SMU, where I had the privilege of dissecting human specimens within Chinaâ€™s first established anatomy department. Over the two years, I meticulously dissected 18 facial muscle and vascular specimens and 45 foot ligament specimens, which were then displayed in our anatomy museum and utilized for systemic and regional anatomy courses for second-year students.

The experience also inspired my early research pursuits, leading me to initiate two projects. The first focused on the anatomy of <code>the superior and inferior labial arteries</code> in relation to safe injection practices in facial aesthetics. This work mapped arterial distances from key landmarks on the lips to enhance guidance on avoiding danger zones in cosmetic injections. The second project, published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, analyzed the anatomical variations in <code>the ATFL and CFL ligaments of the ankle</code> to aid in reconstructive techniques after sprains, dissecting and measuring 66 foot ligament specimens to provide a foundation for ankle ligament reconstruction.
