  <p>
    Hi there, this is Han Yang from China. I am now pursuing my PhD at the VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research (VIB-IRC) in Belgium.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my Master’s, I worked under <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Lu+Feng&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=lu+feng&sc=10-7&sk=&cvid=18447399F9A0442DBB365AEE3B434E0F&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=" target="_blank">Prof. Feng Lu</a> 
    at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University. 
    Lu’s lab is one of the earliest adipose medicine teams in China. My research focuses on using adipose acellular matrix (AAM) to explore 
    vascularization mechanisms in natural biomaterials, particularly fascia-mediated biomaterial vascularization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining Prof. Lu’s group, I spent two years conducting anatomical research under the guidance of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingxing-Dai" target="_blank">Prof. Jingxing Dai</a>. 
    My projects examined (1) the anatomy of facial muscles and blood vessels, aiming to improve injection safety in plastic surgery by reducing risks in facial danger zones, 
    and (2) the anatomy and biomechanics of foot ligaments, providing insights for the reconstruction of ATFL and combined ATFL-CFL sprains.
  </p>
