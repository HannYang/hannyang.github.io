    Hi there, this is Gabija H.Yang from Guangdong, China. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Guangzhou, expected to graduate in June 2025.
  </p>
    Since 2022, I’ve been studying under <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Lu+Feng&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=lu+feng&sc=10-7&sk=&cvid=18447399F9A0442DBB365AEE3B434E0F&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=" target="_blank">Professor Feng Lu</a> at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University. 
    Lu’s lab is one of the earliest adipose medicine teams in China. My research focuses on using adipose acellular matrix (AAM) to explore 
    vascularization mechanisms in natural biomaterials, particularly fascia-mediated biomaterial vascularization. My work includes acellular matrix preparation, 
    animal model construction, in situ matrix tracing, histological evaluation, and collagen fiber analysis, aiming to address tissue regeneration challenges related to vascularization.
  </p>
    Additionally, before joining Professor Lu’s lab, I conducted two years of anatomical research under the guidance of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingxing-Dai" target="_blank">Professor Jingxing Dai</a>. My work mainly focused on 
    the anatomy of (1) facial muscles and blood vessels and (2) foot ligaments. The first aimed to improve injection safety in plastic surgery by reducing risks in facial 
    danger zones, while the second provided anatomical and biomechanical insights for the reconstruction of ATFL and combined ATFL-CFL sprains.
  </p>
    You can find my CV and email here. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email.❤️
  </p>
